# Getting Started with Create React App
Alright, so I was trying to set up a React project, and honestly, it was getting kind of frustrating. After a lot of trial and error (and some unnecessary stress), I decided to let AI help me put this together. So yeah, here we are.

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

### vailable Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

### npm start
Runs the app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to check it out in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You might also see some annoying lint errors pop up in the console.

### npm test
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
If you're like me and hate writing tests, well... good luck.
More details: running tests.

### npm run build
Builds the app for production and dumps everything into the build folder.
It minifies the code, optimizes performance, and makes sure the filenames have hashes.

Basically, it's the step before you deploy your app. Speaking of which...

### Deployment
